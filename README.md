## 📖 About The Project

**AstraNiti** is a web-based social initiative designed to tackle the lack of civic sense in India. It aims to transform the "Chalta Hai" (it's okay) attitude into a culture of responsibility, discipline, and cleanliness.

The platform serves as a hub for education, issue reporting, and self-assessment, encouraging citizens to take a pledge for a better nation.
